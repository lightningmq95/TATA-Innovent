A clicking noise from your steering wheel could be a sign of an issue with the Electronic Power Assisted Steering (EPAS) system in your Tata Punch.  The noise could be coming from the EPAS relay, which is a component that helps control the steering system.  The issue could be as simple as a loose connection or a faulty relay.  However, based on the information found online, other potential causes could include:

* **Worn-out CV joints:** This can cause clicking or creaking noises, especially when turning the steering wheel.
* **Clock spring issues:** This component, also known as a spiral cable, transmits signals from the steering wheel to the airbag and other components.  A worn-out or damaged clock spring can cause clicking noises.
* **Steering column problems:** The steering column houses various components, and issues with them can lead to clicking noises. 

If the noise is accompanied by other symptoms, such as the steering wheel not unlocking normally or the EPAS warning light illuminating, it's best to take your vehicle to a Tata authorized service center for diagnosis and repair.
