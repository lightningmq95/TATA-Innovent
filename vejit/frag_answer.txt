A clicking noise from your steering wheel could be a sign of an issue with the Electronic Power Assisted Steering (EPAS) system in your Tata Punch. The noise could be coming from the EPAS relay, which is a component that helps control the steering system. The issue could be as simple as a loose connection or a faulty relay. If the noise is accompanied by other symptoms, such as the steering wheel not unlocking normally or the EPAS warning light illuminating, it's best to take your vehicle to a Tata authorized service center for diagnosis and repair.
