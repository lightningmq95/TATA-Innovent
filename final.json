        "prompt": "In Tata Punch, how does a vacuum-assisted braking system work?",
        "response": "A vacuum-assisted braking system utilizes engine vacuum to amplify the force applied to the brake pedal. Here's the breakdown:  1. Engine Vacuum: The engine running creates a vacuum in the intake manifold. 2. Vacuum Booster: This vacuum powers the vacuum booster, a component between the brake pedal and the master cylinder. 3. Brake Pedal Pressure: Pressing the brake pedal activates a piston in the vacuum booster. 4. Force Amplification: The vacuum helps push this piston, amplifying the force from the brake pedal. 5. Master Cylinder: This amplified force is transmitted to the master cylinder, pushing brake fluid to the wheels. 6. Braking Action: The brake fluid pressure activates brake calipers, which press brake pads against brake rotors, slowing the wheels and stopping the vehicle."
